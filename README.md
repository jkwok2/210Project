# Productivity All-In-One

#### To-Do List, Pomodoro Timer, and Energy Tracker to help you be more productive!


  What will the application do?

The application will have three sections:
- ToDo List
- Pomodoro Timer
- Energy Tracker and Calendar


At it's core, the application is a ToDo List, which can be used by itself. There is also an attached Pomodoro timer and 
mood tracker. You will then be able to measure how many pomodoros you have spent on completing a task. 
**A Pomodoro is meant to be 25 minutes long.** Furthermore, a user can mark their energy level
before beginning their work. The app will keep statistics on how many pomodoros a user is able to complete when their 
energy is high, and when they are tired; that way, they can *budget their time accordingly* if they know they will be 
less productive.
 
  Who will use it? /  Why is this project of interest to you?

Anyone who wants to improve their productivity - in particular students. I was interested in creating an application 
that would improve productivity, especially one that combined many all the functions of a todo list, timer, and tracker.
There are often moments when one feels that they are productive but aren't actually accomplishing anything, and vice 
versa. I hope to be able to produce that data and assist users that way.
