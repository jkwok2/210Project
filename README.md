# Productivity All-In-One

#### To-Do List to help you be more productive!


  What will the application do?


The application is a ToDo List. *The To-Do list features the name, description, and status of the task.* A 
user can add and remove tasks, as well as change the name, description, and status.
 
  Who will use it? /  Why is this project of interest to you?

Anyone who wants to be able to track their tasks. I was interested in creating an application 
that would improve productivity, especially one that combined many all the functions of a todo list, timer, and tracker.
There are often moments when one feels that they are productive but aren't actually accomplishing anything, and vice 
versa. I hope to be able to produce that data and assist users that way.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to add a task to the ToDoList.
2. As a user, I want to remove a task from the ToDoList.
3. As a user, I want to display the Name, Description, and Status of a TaskItem.
4. As a user, I want to display the number of tasks Not Started, In Progress, and Completed.
5. As a user, I want an option to save all entered tasks to a file.
6. As a user, I want to retrieve all saved tasks from a file. 

## Instructions for Grader
Every time a task is modified on the GUI, it is also modified in the ToDoList and TaskItem classes. This also how the 
save and load functions of the ToDoList are implemented. 

Add X to Y #1: Click 'Add Task' button to add new TaskItem (taken from the JTextArea) to add a task to the GUI and 
create a new TaskItem and add it to the ToDoList Class in model.

Add X to Y #2: Click 'Remove Task' button to remove selected TaskItem (taken from the JTable) to remove a task to the 
GUI and create a new TaskItem and add it to the ToDoList Class in model.

Other User Stories: The name, description, and status of a TaskItem is displayed on the GUI interface. The number
of tasks not started, in progress, and completed are displayed in a JLabel at the top. This is updated every time a task
is added or removed.

Audiovisual Component: 'beep.wav' sound played when 'Add Task' button is clicked and task is added.

Save state of application: Menu dropdown 'Save Data' under 'Options - Select Below'

Load state of application: Menu dropdown 'Load Data' under 'Options - Select Below'
