# Productivity All-In-One

#### To-Do List to help you be more productive!


  What will the application do?


The application is a ToDo List. *The To-Do list features the name, description, and status of the task.* A 
user can add and remove tasks, as well as change the name, description, and status.
 
  Who will use it? /  Why is this project of interest to you?

Anyone who wants to be able to track their tasks. I was interested in creating an application 
that would improve productivity, especially one that combined many all the functions of a todo list, timer, and tracker.
There are often moments when one feels that they are productive but aren't actually accomplishing anything, and vice 
versa. I hope to be able to produce that data and assist users that way.
